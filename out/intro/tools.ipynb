    "You can install Jupyter Notebooks locally, BUT instead we will leverage a Google project called **Colaboratory**, or **Colab** for short.\n",

    "Below are some bonus tools. We won't explicitly review or utilize them during this course, but they are very useful for all types of programming.\n",
