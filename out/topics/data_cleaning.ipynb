    "\n",
    "Having null values in your data can cause various issues with your code and with your analysis. Deciding how to deal with null values is a huge part of cleaning your data, and you have to think about each column contextually. At a high level, you can drop rows/columns containing null values or replace all instances of null values with some default value (e.g. the mean, the value with the highest frequency, \"Unknown\", etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the \"how\", you also have to contextually consider the \"when\". For example, we had to get rid of all rows containing TV shows before we could sort by year because those rows contained non-numeric values such as \"2009-2017\". In this lesson, we'll be dropping rows with null values as we explore different concepts and consider different variables.\n",

    "Typecasting a Series is one of the most basic elementwise functions. Most commonly in cleaning your data, you'll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pd.to_numeric(s)`: typecast the items in a Series to ints or floats; will infer which numeric type is best\n",

    "\n",
    "For the next few example, we'll leverage the `s.map(arg, na_action=None)` function, another **elementwise** function. You can use the `.map(arg, na_action=None)` function to substitute or transform each value in a Series with another value. `.map()` itself serves to pass along \"instructions\" for how to manipulate each element in the Series. Accordingly, the `arg` parameter will accept single-argument functions, dicts, or Series. As you might imagine, `.map()` requires us to pass it a \"mapping\" for the before and after values.\n",
