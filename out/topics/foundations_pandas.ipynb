    "**Pandas** is an open-source Python library of data structures and tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Pandas primarily facilitates acquisition, cleaning, formatting, and manipulating. Used in tandem with NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and other Python libraries, Pandas is an integral part of practicing data science. Its core capabilities include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Robust IO tools to read from flat files (CSV and TXT), JSON, XML, Excel files, SQL tables, and other databases.\n",
    "* Axis reindexing and hierarchical labeling of matrix-like `dataframes`\n",
    "* Data manipulation, by applying `vectorized operations` or by iterating through datasets\n",
    "* Handling duplicates and missing data\n",
    "* Conditional queries for sorting, filtering, & subsetting\n",
    "* Merging & joining datasets\n",
    "* Reshaping, transforming, & pivoting datasets\n",
    "* Basics statistics\n",
    "* Time-series functionality, e.g. date shifting, frequency conversions, & moving window statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Data Science Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you have to do start a new analysis is import whichever data science libraries you plan to use. Pandas is built on top of NumPy, so you have to import that separately every time you plan to use pandas. Notice the standard abbreviations used for later references of the libraries.\n"

As we just saw, the main purpose of a Pandas `Index` object is to store the labels for each axis in a `Series` or `Dataframe`. The values *do NOT have to be unique*. However, to avoid ambuity in your data structure, you should always use unique values when creating a custom index.\n",

To access a specific item in a regular Python `list`, you reference its numerical position in the list.

The scenario below explains the functional difference index positioning and `Index` labels.\n",
