    "\n",
    "Over the next few lessons, we will use Pandas to wrangle, clean, explore, analyze, and visualize data. We know that the data science lifecycle is NOT made of discrete, linear steps. As such, we will not review one-off examples of each function or attribute. Instead, we will walk through the analysis of a dataset together. We will integrate Pandas examples based on how and when we need to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might get a little confusing, so brace yourself! Ultimately though, this approach will help you apply the material on your own much more easily. To help keep things as consistent as possible, we'll use the same dataset across units.

    "Our complete movies dataset contains a *lot* more movie metadata from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). When you work with a large dataset, you should always include a `data dictionary`, or a list of variable definitions, alongside your notebook. It can serve as a contextual overview of the variables in the dataset as well as share information about how certain variables are formatted. If you're looking to study a dataset yourself, the data dictionary can also give you high-level ideas for what you might want to analyze and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a data dictionary for the *unaltered OMDb data*. (We've left the definitions for a few self-explanatory variables blank.) If it seems disorganized and convoluted... that's because it is! The fields and formats here are the original ones obtained straight from the OMDB API. \n",

    "* **Actors**\n",
    "* **Plot**\n",
    "* **Language**: Audio languages available for movie (might exclude sub-title language availability)\n",
    "* **Country**: Country/countries that produced the movie \n",
    "* **Awards**: # of nominations and # of wins for one or more types of awards\n",
    "* **Poster**: Amazon-hosted image url for the poster of the movie\n",
    "* **Ratings**: Series containing ratings from multiple sources (e.g. Rotten Tomatoes)\n",
