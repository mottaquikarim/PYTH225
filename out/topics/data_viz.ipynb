    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll discuss what plotting capabilities are available with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We'll combine a cherry-picking of features that will allow you to create common plots with elegance, but relative ease. Here is a summary of points we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A review of qualitative data viz best practices\n",
    "* The anatomy of a plot and the building blocks of data visualizations\n",
    "* Styling with Seaborn\n",
    "* Example code for common plots using Pandas, Seaborn, and elements of Matplotlib\n",
    "\t* Histograms\n",
    "\t* Box-and-Whiskers Plots\n",
    "\t* Bar Charts\n",
    "\t* Line Graphs\n",
    "\t* Scatterplots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a brief review of the key points about data visualization & storytelling from the \"Data Science Foundations\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualizations serve to quickly explain features and conclusions about data to your stakeholders.\n",
    "* As such, they should be *simple*, *uncluttered*, and *clearly labeled*. Less is more.\n",
    "* Visual considerations include position, color, order, & size.\n",
    "* The best visualizations tell a story about the data by illustrating key points supporting your thesis and conclusions.\n",
    "* Most importantly, *consider your audience* when crafting your story.\n",
    "* The chart type you select should accurately represent the variables you are pulling from data in a way that is clearly readable for your audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to Plotting Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with where the different libraries fit in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Matplotlib is the foundational data viz library in Python. Plotting functionality in other libraries is built on top of Matplotlib. Matplotlib is vastly flexible, but also quite complex. \n",
    "* Pandas plotting capabilities are limited to the basics. Pandas provides a way to plot using your Series or DataFrame object as a base. (We'll explain that shortly). Any bells and whistles require you to incorporate Matplotlib.\n",
    "* Seaborn specializes in statistical visualizations. It simplifies the creation of a collection of statistical plots, but it lacks some of the customization options that Matplotlib provides.\n"

    "* When you create a subplot, it automatically creates an **Axes** object. This is where the data actually gets graphed.\n",
    "* Spines refer to the outlines of the axes (bottom (x-axis), left (y-axis), top, and right)\n",
